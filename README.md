# Implementing IBM DeepSearch for PDF Parsing and Converting the parsed JSON to text

IBM DeepSearch Link - https://ds4sd.github.io/

In this repo, I'm trying the parse the PDFs which I downloaded form [UN Global Digital Compact PDF Submissions](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/global-digital-compact) and I'm trying to parse the pdf to text to build custom data ingestion for my another project.
